# TASK-0053 â€” release workflow release notes integration

## Summary
- Added a TypeScript release-notes composer that aggregates the `## Summary` sections from `versions/CHANGELOG-*` entries and
  exposes it via `npm run release:notes` plus unit coverage.
- Updated the `private-action-release` workflow to accept manual release item identifiers, compose Markdown notes once, and reuse
  them for both the action and schema releases.
- Documented the new workflow input and preview command so release engineers consistently publish the curated summaries instead of
  GitHub's auto-generated notes.

## Command log
- source .env
- npm run lint
- npm run build
- npm run test:release-notes
- npm run release:notes -- --items TASK-0052

## Notes
- Workflow continues to skip GitHub's autogenerated notes in favor of curated changelog summaries and falls back to changed
  `versions/` entries when no manual IDs are supplied.
