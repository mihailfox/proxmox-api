# TASK-0014 – Create GitHub templates (Revision 1)

## Summary
- Added a repository-wide pull request template aligning with the mandated checklist and testing commands.
- Introduced a Conventional Commit message template under `.github/` for consistent commit authoring guidance.
- Updated the TASK-0014 worklog to capture progress and recorded deferrals for non-applicable checklist items.

## Command Log
- `sed -n '1,160p' README.md`
- `mkdir -p .github`
- `cat <<'EOF' > .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `apply_patch` edits to refine template guidance and task log entries.
- `cat <<'EOF' > .github/commit_template.md`
- `rm .runonce`
- `git status -sb`
- `git rev-parse --short HEAD`

## Decisions
- Focused changes on documentation-only assets to respect the scoped directories in the task definition.
- Prefilled the PR template with the standard checklist and acceptance commands to streamline compliance.
- Documented skipped automation, testing, and QA steps as deferrals because the task only touched Markdown templates.

## Outcomes
- Contributors now have ready-to-use templates for both pull requests and Conventional Commit messages.
- Repository workflow documentation remains centralized within `.github/` for discoverability.
- Project history reflects why test-related steps were intentionally omitted.

## Deferrals
- Automated checks and builds (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`) – not run because no executable code changed.
- Schema synchronization workflows – not applicable to static template updates.
- Functional QA flows – not impacted by Markdown-only modifications.
