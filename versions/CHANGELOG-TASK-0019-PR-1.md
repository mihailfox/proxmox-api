# Changelog – TASK-0019

## Summary
- Created planning document for packaging the automation pipeline as a private GitHub Action.
- Added follow-up task tickets (TASK-0020 → TASK-0024) covering requirements, entry point refactor, action implementation, release automation, and adoption documentation.
- Updated TASK-0019 checklist to record completed planning work and deferrals for execution-specific checks.

## Source materials consulted
- plan/proxmox-openapi-extraction-plan.md
- docs/handover/README.md
- docs/automation/README.md

## Command log
No repository commands were executed beyond file edits; build/test workflows were deferred because this change only adds planning documentation and task tickets.

## Decisions
- Documented five sequential implementation tasks to deliver the private GitHub Action while preserving existing pipeline behaviour.
- Chose a dedicated plan document under `plan/` to centralize objectives, risks, and success criteria for the action effort.
