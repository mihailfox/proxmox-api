# TASK-0016 normalize ir cache

## Summary
- Regenerated the normalized IR artifact from the cached raw snapshot after removing the corrupted file.
- Updated downstream OpenAPI metadata to reflect the refreshed normalization timestamp.
- Recorded verification steps and automation pipeline run.

## Command log
- `npm run automation:pipeline`
- `npm install`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:normalizer`
- `npm run test:openapi`

## Notes
- Schema sync was not required because the pipeline reused the cached raw snapshot.
- No documentation updates were necessary for this cache repair.
