# Changelog â€“ TASK-0035 (PR) Revision 1

## Summary
- Regenerated the `.github/actions/proxmox-openapi-artifacts` distribution bundle to clear the private-action-release drift.
- Documented the executed packaging steps inside `plan/private-action-release-dist-sync.md` and updated task tracking.

## Command log
- 2025-02-14: `npm install --prefix .github/actions/proxmox-openapi-artifacts`
- 2025-02-14: `npm run package --prefix .github/actions/proxmox-openapi-artifacts`
- 2025-02-14: `if [ -f .env ]; then source .env; fi`
- 2025-02-14: `npm install`
- 2025-02-14: `npm run lint`
- 2025-02-14: `npm run build`
- 2025-02-14: `npm test`

## Decisions and outcomes
- Verified regenerated dist files only include bundler output changes; no source edits were necessary.
- Deferred manual QA because automated smoke tests cover the updated bundle scope.
