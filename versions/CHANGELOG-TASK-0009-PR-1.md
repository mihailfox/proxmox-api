# TASK-0009 coding standards

## Summary
- Documented shared coding standards covering TypeScript style, Playwright usage, testing gates, and review workflow.
- Introduced repository-wide `.editorconfig` and tightened Biome formatting defaults to reflect the standards.
- Linked the coding standards from the main README to surface the new guidance.

## Command log
- `npm run lint`

## Notes
- `.env` is not present in the repository, so no environment sourcing was required.
- Feedback capture guidance now lives alongside the standards for future iterations.
