- docs/handover/README.md
- docs/qa/regression-checklist.md
- docs/contributing/coding-standards.md

Scope
- Focus areas. plan/, docs/, versions/ guidelines.
- Out of scope. Application source code, tooling implementations.
- Data model and types. Canonical documentation structure in docs/ and versions/ directories.

Allowed changes
- Documentation updates describing changelog summary usage.
- Task planning artifacts.
- No code or schema modifications.

Branch
- feature/2025-10-03---task-0051-summary-release-plan

Preconditions
- Run: source .env (if exists)
- Ensure required CLIs are authenticated. (Not applicable.)
- Confirm the repository has the PR template and standard scripts.

Plan checklist
- [x] Read the Source of Truth in order. Extract requirements into a short list.
- [ ] (defer) Schema or type sync not applicable for documentation planning.
      Example with GitHub CLI:
      - [ ] (defer) gh workflow run "<WORKFLOW NAME>" --ref <BRANCH> – no schema sync required.
      - [ ] (defer) Verify updated schema, seed data, and generated types.
- [x] Audit the current implementation in the focus area.
      - [x] Trace data flow from settings or inputs through persistence to output.
      - [x] Identify missing mappings or dead configuration.
- [ ] (defer) Implementation code changes out of scope for planning task.
      - [ ] (defer) Keep models aligned with generated types or schemas.
      - [ ] (defer) Remove unused config and wire only supported options end to end.
- [ ] (defer) Persistence wiring not applicable (documentation plan only).
      - [ ] (defer) Validate input values.
      - [ ] (defer) Persist to storage or API and read back.
      - [ ] (defer) Handle undefined and default values.
- [ ] Tests and checks.
      - [x] source .env
      - [ ] (defer) Install dependencies – unchanged from baseline for documentation task.
      - [ ] (defer) Run linter – no code changes introduced.
      - [ ] (defer) Build project or artifacts – not required for planning docs.
      - [ ] (defer) Run unit and integration tests – not applicable.
- [ ] Functional QA.
      - [ ] (defer) Verify expected behavior on key user flows or endpoints.
      - [ ] (defer) Confirm no regressions in critical paths.
- [x] Documentation.
      - [x] Update docs only if behavior changed. Keep changes concise.
- [x] Commits using Conventional Commits.
      - [x] feat(...), fix(...), chore(...), docs(...), refactor(...)
- [ ] Open PR.
      - [ ] Use the repo PR template.
      - [ ] Title: feat: TASK-{NNNN} {short description}
      - [ ] Body: link this task file, paste checklist, tick completed items, list deferrals.
- [ ] Changelog.
      - [ ] Create versions/CHANGELOG-TASK-{NNNN}-{PR or short hash}-1.md
      - [ ] Include the command log, key decisions, and outcomes.
- [ ] Done.
      - [ ] Mark remaining boxes as - [ ] (defer) with reasons.
