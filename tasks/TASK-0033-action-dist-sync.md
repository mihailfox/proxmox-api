Title
- Repair private action release dist sync

Source of truth
- plan/private-github-action-plan.md
- docs/automation/README.md
- docs/automation/private-action-adoption.md
- docs/automation/private-action-task-review.md

Scope
- Focus areas. .github/actions/proxmox-openapi-artifacts (src, dist, package metadata), .github/workflows/private-action-release.yml.
- Out of scope. tools/automation/src beyond import compatibility, downstream app/ docs unrelated to private action.
- Data model and types. Canonical automation pipeline types defined in tools/automation/src and generated OpenAPI artifacts committed in docs/openapi.

Allowed changes
- Update TypeScript action source, bundled dist output, and workflow packaging steps to keep dist in sync.
- Adjust documentation strictly related to the private action release process.
- Shared utilities only if required for packaging parity (non-breaking additions).
- No schema or OpenAPI artifact edits.

Branch
- feature/2025-10-01---task-0033-action-dist-sync

Preconditions
- Run: source .env (if exists)
- Ensure Node.js/npm available via repo toolchain.
- Confirm repository includes PR template and standard scripts.
