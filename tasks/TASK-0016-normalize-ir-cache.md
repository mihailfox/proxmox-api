Title
- Regenerate Proxmox API normalized IR cache.

Source of truth
- plan/proxmox-openapi-extraction-plan.md
- docs/automation/README.md

Requirements summary
- Maintain deterministic automation pipeline regenerating normalized IR from cached raw snapshot in CI mode.
- Keep normalized IR JSON valid and version-controlled alongside pipeline outputs.

Scope
- Focus: tools/api-normalizer/data/ir, docs/openapi
- Out of scope: app, public, node_modules
- Data model and types: Canonical schema generated by automation pipeline.

Allowed changes
- Update normalized IR cache in focus area.
- Adjust supporting scripts if required for regeneration.
- No schema edits.

Branch
- feature/task-0016-normalize-ir-cache

Preconditions
- Run: source .env (if exists)
- Ensure required CLIs are authenticated.
- Confirm the repository has the PR template and standard scripts.

Plan checklist
- [x] Read the Source of Truth in order. Extract requirements into a short list.
- [ ] (defer) If the project syncs schema or types from a remote system, trigger the sync on the target branch. Not required for cached IR regeneration.
      Example with GitHub CLI:
      - [ ] (defer) gh workflow run "<WORKFLOW NAME>" --ref <BRANCH>
      - [ ] (defer) Verify updated schema, seed data, and generated types.
- [x] Audit the current implementation in the focus area.
      - [x] Trace data flow from settings or inputs through persistence to output.
      - [x] Identify missing mappings or dead configuration.
- [x] Implement changes with small, focused commits.
      - [x] Keep models aligned with generated types or schemas.
      - [x] Remove unused config and wire only supported options end to end.
- [ ] (defer) Wire persistence and retrieval. Not applicable to static artifact regeneration.
      - [ ] (defer) Validate input values.
      - [ ] (defer) Persist to storage or API and read back.
      - [ ] (defer) Handle undefined and default values.
- [x] Tests and checks.
      - [x] source .env
      - [x] Install dependencies.
      - [x] Run linter.
      - [x] Build project or artifacts.
      - [x] Run unit and integration tests.
- [x] Functional QA.
      - [x] Verify expected behavior on key user flows or endpoints.
      - [x] Confirm no regressions in critical paths.
- [ ] (defer) Documentation. No doc updates needed for cache repair.
      - [ ] (defer) Update docs only if behavior changed. Keep changes concise.
- [x] Commits using Conventional Commits.
      - [x] feat(...), fix(...), chore(...), docs(...), refactor(...)
- [x] Open PR.
      - [x] Use the repo PR template.
      - [x] Title: feat: TASK-0016 normalize ir cache
      - [x] Body: link this task file, paste checklist, tick completed items, list deferrals.
- [x] Changelog.
      - [x] Create versions/CHANGELOG-TASK-0016-<PR or short hash>-1.md
      - [x] Include the command log, key decisions, and outcomes.
- [x] Done.
      - [x] Mark remaining boxes as - [ ] (defer) with reasons.
