Title
- Implement automation summary integration into release changelog workflow.

Source of truth
- docs/product-requirements.md
- docs/handover/README.md
- docs/qa/regression-checklist.md
- plan/versions-summary-integration.md

Scope
- Focus: tools/automation/scripts, docs, versions templates, workflow configuration, npm scripts.
- Out of scope: API schema definitions, frontend application features unrelated to release documentation, backend service integrations.
- Data model and types: Use the automation pipeline summary schema defined by existing JSON outputs and generated TypeScript types in tools/automation.

Allowed changes
- Introduce formatter utilities and supporting scripts within tools/automation/scripts.
- Update documentation detailing release processes.
- Adjust workflow or task templates necessary to embed automation summary sections.
- Avoid breaking existing automation APIs or modifying schema contracts unless specified by requirements.

Branch
- feature/20251003---task-0052-automation-summary-integration

Preconditions
- Run: source .env (if exists)
- Ensure npm scripts for automation pipeline are runnable locally.
- Confirm repository PR template and scripts are up to date.

Plan checklist
- [x] Read the Source of Truth in order. Extract requirements into a short list. *(docs/product-requirements.md not present; confirmed absence while gathering inputs.)*
- [ ] (defer) If the project syncs schema or types from a remote system, trigger the sync on the target branch. *(No external schema sync configured for automation tooling.)*
      Example with GitHub CLI:
      - [ ] (defer) gh workflow run "<WORKFLOW NAME>" --ref <BRANCH>
      - [ ] (defer) Verify updated schema, seed data, and generated types.
- [x] Audit the current implementation in the focus area.
      - [x] Trace data flow from settings or inputs through persistence to output.
      - [x] Identify missing mappings or dead configuration.
- [x] Implement changes with small, focused commits.
      - [x] Keep models aligned with generated types or schemas.
      - [x] Remove unused config and wire only supported options end to end.
- [x] Wire persistence and retrieval.
      - [x] Validate input values.
      - [x] Persist to storage or API and read back.
      - [x] Handle undefined and default values.
- [x] Tests and checks.
      - [x] source .env
      - [x] Install dependencies.
      - [x] Run linter.
      - [x] Build project or artifacts.
      - [x] Run unit and integration tests.
- [x] Functional QA.
      - [x] Verify expected behavior on key user flows or endpoints.
      - [x] Confirm no regressions in critical paths.
- [x] Documentation.
      - [x] Update docs only if behavior changed. Keep changes concise.
- [x] Commits using Conventional Commits.
      - [x] feat(...), fix(...), chore(...), docs(...), refactor(...)
- [x] Open PR.
      - [x] Use the repo PR template.
      - [x] Title: feat: TASK-0052 {short description}
      - [x] Body: link this task file, paste checklist, tick completed items, list deferrals.
- [x] Changelog.
      - [x] Create versions/CHANGELOG-TASK-0052-{PR or short hash}-1.md
      - [x] Include the command log, key decisions, and outcomes.
- [x] Done.
      - [x] Mark remaining boxes as - [ ] (defer) with reasons.
